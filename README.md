# ChadSoft Auto Fetcher
This repository contains a GitHub workflow that automatically fetches the five latest CT runs from the [ChadSoft API (index.json)](https://tt.chadsoft.co.uk/index.json) every 24 hours.

The data about the runs are stored in a JSON file and automatically committed to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/ForgottenIce/chadsoft-auto-fetcher/tree/gh-pages) branch.
